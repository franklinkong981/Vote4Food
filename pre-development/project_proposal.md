Vouch4Food Initial Proposal/Statement of Intent: <br>Have you ever been to a restaurant and wished you could see pictures of the menu items? Or wondered what the most popular dishes there were? Or the general opinion of a specific dish that looks interesting? I plan to offer a solution with a website where users can search up specific restaurants theyâ€™ve been to and leave reviews for it, as well as more specific reviews for menu items they had at the restaurant. Each restaurant will have a menu section that consists of the individual menu items at the restaurant and includes pictures of them. Users can also favorite retaurants and menu items, as well as leave reviews for them

Tech stack: <br>
I plan to use HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript, Axios, Python, Flask, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, WTForms, and Bcrypt for user registration/login.

Type: <br> This will be a website.

Goal: <br> This website will aim to give more context to restaurant reviews by including a menu item section where users can see pictures, information, and reviews of specific menu items at a restaurant to gauge which items are most popular at a restaurant, as even well-liked restaurants can have their share of mediocre menu items. Users will now be able to identify which menu items are popular among guests at a restaurant location so they can be better informed on what to order when they visit.

Users/demogrpahic: <br> The demographic will be towards the general public. Anyone who wants to know specific information about a restaurant in terms of what the menu items look like and what dishes ar well-liked can visit the website.

Data: <br> I am going to use the Spoonacular API to fetch restaurant and menu item data, as well as the PositionStack Geolocation API to turn a zip code into latitude and longitude coordinates which will then be inputted into the Spoonacular API restaurant search routes to return a list of restaurants near those coordinates. This way, users will be able to search for nearby restaurants by zip code and get a list of restaurants near them on their account homepage.
