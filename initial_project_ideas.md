# Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentor!

1. Lyrics Search App - Users can create their own account, log in, and search up details (like name, artist, album, release date, etc.) of a song they like by typing in a part of the lyrics (ie. They just heard a song on the radio they like but can only make out the chorus). Users can thenview their lyric search history and can bookmark songs they find. Uses the lyrics.com Lyrics API.

2. Movie Point-based Recommendation App - There do exist websites that recommend movies where users can set their own preferences, but some criteria matter more to a user than others. This app aims to recommend movies based on a point-recommendation system set by the user (ex. 2 points if the movie was released after the year 2000, 1 point if it was directed by Martin Scorecese, etc.) and sorts recommendations by movies that achieve the most points. Users can register/login and set their movie preferences and point values. Users can also save movies (aka add it to a watchlist), favorite them, mark movies they’ve watched, and create/update/delete reviews for movies they watched. Uses the Open Movie Database API and/or the TMDB API. (THIS IS THE ONE I'M LEANING TOWARDS)

3. Fun Fact Portal - Users can create their own account, log in, and set preferences on topics theyre interested in and what kind of fun facts they’d like to see, and get personalized recommended list of fun facts. They can bookmark/favorite fun facts and also share these fun facts via email, Twitter, etc.
